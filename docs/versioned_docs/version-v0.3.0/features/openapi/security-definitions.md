# Adding OAuth security definition to API operations

When an API is secured via OAuth, it is helpful if the Open API documentation makes this clear via a security scheme and the API operations that require authorization automatically inform the consumer that it is possible that a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response is returned.
The `OAuthAuthorizeOperationFilter` that is part of this package exposes this functionality.

## Installation

This feature requires to install our NuGet package

```shell
PM > Install-Package Arcus.WebApi.OpenApi.Extensions -Version 0.3.0
```

## Usage

To indicate that an API is protected by OAuth, you need to add `AuthorizeCheckOperationFilter` as an `OperationFilter` when configuring Swashbuckles Swagger generation:

```csharp
using Arcus.WebApi.OpenApi.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSwaggerGen(setupAction =>
        {
            setupAction.SwaggerDoc("v1", new Info { Title = "My API v1", Version = "v1" });
            setupAction.AddSecurityDefinition("oauth2", new OAuth2Scheme
            {
               Flow = "implicit",
               AuthorizationUrl = $"{authorityUrl}connect/authorize",
               Scopes = scopes
            });
            setupAction.OperationFilter<OAuthAuthorizeOperationFilter>(new object[] {new [] {"myApiScope1", "myApiScope2"});
        });
    }
}
```
