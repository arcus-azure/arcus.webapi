# Introduction

The Arcus Web API library provides an easy way to register and configure complex functionality to your application. We provides ways to add shared access key authentication, HTTP correlation, request tracking, strict JSON formatting, and other boilerplate code that can be added with zero effort. It builds on top of [Arcus Observability](https://observability.arcus-azure.net/) to provide its HTTP correlation and request tracking. All functionality described here is also available in our [project templates](https://templates.arcus-azure.net/).

# Installation

The Arcus.WebApi library can be installed via NuGet.

To install all Arcus.WebApi packages:

```shell
PM > Install-Package Arcus.WebApi.All
```

For more granular packages we recommend reading the documentation.
